<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a little girl or boy helps another who is in
trouble, they are sure to be the best of friends.
In the early days, before this country became
a great nation, when the Colonies were at war
with England, fighting for the independence
and freedom which we now celebrate each year
on the Fourth of July, a French nobleman by
the name of Lafayette came across the sea to
help us. We needed his help, and when the
brave Colonial soldiers at last won a great
victory, and the Colonies became one nation, we
were very grateful to Lafayette for the help he
had given, and because he was a Frenchman,
the people of France and the people of the
United States became fast friends.</p>

<p>This story was written to help us learn more
about our wonderful French cousins. Germaine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
"Our Little French Cousin," happened
to live in Normandy, but her every-day life, her
parents and her friends were just like those of
other French children. True, she travelled more
than most children, but if she had not, the story
would not tell so much about other parts of
her native land.</p>

<p>It was in the early days of August, 1914, that
the French people learned that Germany, her
conqueror in the Franco-Prussian war, had
again declared war, and was even then hammering
at the forts of Belgium so she could march
her armies right into their beloved France.</p>

<p>The news stirred the French people, but while
the brave little army of Belgians halted the German
troops, an army was gathered quickly under
the leadership of Joseph-Jacques-Cesaire Joffre,
a man of humble birth whom every one loved.
We all know how the Prussian army defeated
the Belgians and how the French were forced
to retreat until they reached the River Marne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and then how they made a stand which resulted
in such a glorious victory for France.</p>

<p>During these bitter days Germaine, and thousands
of other French children, learned how to
suffer and yet smile. She learned that her beloved
France could produce heroes as great as
Bayard, Du Guesclin, Ney, Henry of Navarre,
Lafayette and Rochambeau. She never tired of
hearing stories of the great General Petain, a
quiet, reserved man who filled his troops with
a new spirit which urged them on to another
great victory at Verdun.</p>

<p>When, in 1917, the American soldiers went
to France to help the French, the English, the
Canadians, the Australians, the Belgians and
all the other Allies drive the Germans out of
France and Belgium, General Pershing, commander
of the American Army, visited the tomb
of Lafayette. He placed a wreath upon the
tomb and made the greatest speech that was ever
made in so few words. He said, "Lafayette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
we're here." So we repaid our debt to France.</p>

<p>Then General Ferdinand Foch was made
Commander-in-chief of all the armies that
France and all the other nations had raised to
show the Germans that right is greater than
might. Then Germaine became even more
proud of her native land when she was told of
Georges Clemenceau, the "Tiger" premier, who
was so brave and so sure, always, of success, and
who played such a great part in making peace
again throughout the world.</p>

<p>As a reward for her many sacrifices during
the four years of the most cruel war the world
has ever known, France regained her two lost
provinces, Alsace and Lorraine. In another
volume, "Our Little Alsatian Cousin," is told
the story of the home life, the work and the
play of the little folks who live in these provinces
which were long a part of Germany, not because
the people wanted it, but because Germany had
won the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Our</span> Little French Cousin" is an attempt
to tell, in plain, simple language, something of
the daily life of a little French girl, living in a
Norman village, in one of the most progressive
and opulent sections of France.</p>

<p>The old divisions, or ancient provinces, of
France each had its special characteristics and
manners and customs, which to this day have
endured to a remarkable extent.</p>

<p>To American children, no less than to our
English cousins, the memories of the great
names of history which have come down to us
from ancient Norman times are very numerous.</p>

<p>Besides the great Norman William who
conquered England, and Richard the Lion-hearted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
there are the lesser lights, such as
Champlain, La Salle, and Jean Denys,&mdash;the
discoverer of Newfoundland; and before them
was the Northman ancestor of Rollo, Lief, the
son of Eric, who was perhaps the real discoverer
of America. All these link Normandy
with the New World in a manner that is perhaps
not at first remembered.</p>

<p>"Our Little French Cousin" lives in Normandy,
simply because she must live somewhere,
and not because any attempt has been
made to specialize or localize the every-day
life of Germaine, her parents, and her friends.
Indeed, for a little French girl, it may be
thought that she had remarkable opportunities
for acquaintanceship with the outside world.</p>

<p>But to-day even little French girls live in a
progressive world, and what with tourists and
automobilists, to say nothing of a reasonably
large colony of English-speaking folk who had
actually settled near her home, it was but natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
that her outlook was somewhat different
from what it might have been had she lived a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>So far as France in general goes, the great
world of Paris, and much that lay beyond,
were also brought to her notice in, it is believed,
a perfectly rational and plausible fashion;
and thus within the restricted limits of
this little book will be found many references
to the life and history of Old France which, in
one way or another, has linked itself with the
early days in the history of America, in a
manner of which little American cousins are
in no way ignorant.</p>

<p>Joliet, Champlain, La Salle, Père Marquette,
and many others first pointed the way
and mapped out the civilization of America,
when it was but the home of the red man, now
so nearly disappeared.</p>

<p>Later came Lafayette and Rochambeau,
who were indeed good friends to the then new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
nation, and lastly, if it is permissible to think
of it in that light, the great Statue of Liberty,
in New York Harbour, is another witness of
the friendliness of the French nation for the
people of the United States. A reciprocal
echo of this is found in the recent erection, in
Paris, of a statue of Washington.</p>

<p>To her cousins across the sea little Germaine,
"Our Little French Cousin," holds
out a cordial hand of greeting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>AT THE FARM OF LA CHAUMIÈRE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, mamma!" cried little Germaine, as
she jumped out of bed and ran to the window,
"how glad I am it is such a beautiful day."</p>

<p>Germaine was up bright and early on this
sunshiny day, for many pleasant things were
going to happen. However, this was not her
only reason for early rising. French people
always do so, and little French children are
not allowed to lie in bed and to be lazy.</p>

<p>At the first peep of daylight Germaine's
papa and mamma were up, and soon the
"little breakfast," as it is called, was ready in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the big kitchen of the farmhouse. Even the
well-to-do farmers, like Germaine's papa, eat
their meals in their kitchens, which are also
used as a general sitting-room.</p>

<p>Everything about a French house is very
neat, but especially so is the kitchen, whose
bare wooden or stone floor is waxed and
polished every day until it shines like polished
mahogany. On the mantelpiece of the kitchen
of Germaine's home, which was more than
twice as tall as Germaine herself, was a long
row of brass candlesticks, a vase or two, and
a little statue of the Madonna with flowers
before it.</p>

<p>The fireplace took up nearly all of one
side of the room, and was so large that it
held a bench in either side where one could
sit and keep nice and warm in winter. Hanging
in the centre, over the fire, was a big crane,&mdash;a
chain with a hook on the end of it on
which to hang pots and kettles to boil. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
were beautiful blue tiles all around the fireplace,
and a ruffle of cloth along the edge of
the mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>Not far from the fireplace was a good cooking-stove,
for the better class farmers do not
cook much on the open fire, as do the peasants.</p>

<p>All about the walls were hung row after row
of copper cooking utensils of all kinds and
shapes, all highly polished with "<i>eau de cuivre</i>."
Madame Lafond, Germaine's mamma,
prided herself on having all her pots and pans
shine like mirrors.</p>

<p>"Be quick, my little one," said Madame
Lafond, as Germaine seated herself at the
table in the centre of the room. "You have
much to do, for, as you know, we are to see
M. Auguste before we go to meet Marie;
and we must finish our work here, so as to be
off at an early hour."</p>

<p>Germaine's breakfast was a great bowl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
hot milk, with coffee and a slice from the big
loaf lying on the bare table. The French
have many nice kinds of bread, and what they
call household bread, made partly of flour and
partly of rye, is the kind generally eaten by
the country people. It is a little dark in colour,
but very good.</p>

<p>It was to-day that Germaine was to go with
Madame Lafond to the station at Petit Andelys
to meet her sister Marie, who had been
away at a convent school at Evreux, and who
was coming home for the summer holidays.
On their way they were to stop at the Hôtel
Belle Étoile, for it was the birthday&mdash;the fête-day,
as the French call it&mdash;of their good
friend the proprietor, M. Auguste, and Madame
Lafond was taking him a little present
of some fine <i>white</i> strawberries which are quite
a delicacy, and which are grown only round
about. M. Lafond was to meet them at the
station, and all were to take dinner with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Uncle Daboll at his house in the village, to
celebrate Marie's home-coming.</p>

<p>So, as may be imagined, Germaine did not
linger over her breakfast, but set to work at
her morning tasks with a will.</p>

<p>"Blanche, you want your breakfast, too,"
she said, as she stroked her pet white turtledove,
who had been walking over the table
trying to attract her attention with soft, deep
"coos," "and you shall have it here in the
sunshine," and, putting her pet on the deep
window-ledge, she sprinkled before it a bountiful
supply of crumbs. "That, now, must
last until I get back."</p>

<p>"Now, come, Raton," she called to their
big dog. "We must feed the rabbits," and,
taking a basket of green stuff, she ran across
the courtyard into the garden.</p>

<p>In France the farm buildings are often built
around an open square, which is entered by a
large gate. This is called a <i>closed</i> farm. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
olden times there were also the fortified farms,
which were built strongly enough to withstand
the assaults of marauders, and some of
these can still be seen in various parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The gateway was rather a grand affair, with
big stone pillars, on top of which was a stone
vase, and in the gate was a smaller one, which
could be used when there was no need to open
the large one to allow a carriage or wagon to
enter.</p>

<p>On one side of the yard was the <i>laiterie</i>,
where the cows were kept and milked. There
were a number of cows, for M. Lafond sold
milk and butter, carrying it into the market at
Grand Andelys.</p>

<p>On another side was the stable, where were
kept the big farm-horses,&mdash;Norman horses as
we know them, one of the three celebrated
breeds of horses in France. Near by were
the wire-enclosed houses for the chickens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
geese and the ducks, which ran about the yard
at will and paddled in the little pond in one
corner.</p>

<p>In the centre was the pigeon-house, a large,
round, stone building, such as will be seen on
all the old farms like this of M. Lafond's. It
was an imposing structure, and looked as if it
could shelter hundreds of pigeon families.
Under a low shed stood the farm-wagons and
the farming tools and implements.</p>

<p><i>La Chaumière</i>, as the farm was known,
took its name from the thatch-covered cottage.
Many of the houses in this part of the country
have roofs thatched with straw, as had the
other buildings on the farm. Germaine's
home, however, had a red tile roof, though it
was thatched in the olden days, for it had been
in M. Lafond's family for many generations.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the house was the
garden, surrounded by a high wall finished off
with a sort of roof of red tiles. The square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
beds of fine vegetables were bordered by flowers,
for in France the two are usually cultivated
together in one garden. Against the wall were
trained peach, pear, and plum trees, as if they
were vines; this to ripen the fruit well. In a
corner were piled up the glass globes,&mdash;shaped
like a bell or a beehive,&mdash;which are used to
put over the young and tender plants to protect
them and hasten their growth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i027.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="farmyard" />
<div class="caption">THE FARM OF <i>LA CHAUMIÈRE</i></div>
</div>

<p>Against one corner of the wall were the
hutches for the rabbits, built in tiers, one above
the other, and full of dozens of pretty "bunnies,"
white, black and white, and some quite
black.</p>

<p>It was Germaine's duty to feed them night
and morning, and she liked nothing better
than to give them crisp lettuce and cabbage
leaves and see them nibble them up, wriggling
their funny little noses all the time. "Well,
bunnies, you will have to eat your breakfast
alone this morning; I cannot spare you much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
time," Germaine told them, as she gave them
the contents of her basket. Raton was leaping
beside her and barking, for he was a great pet,
and more of a companion than most dogs in
French farms. They are usually kept strictly
for watch purposes, the poor things being tied
up in the yard all of the time; but Germaine's
people were very kind to animals, and Raton
did much as he pleased.</p>

<p>"I am ready, mamma," said Germaine, running
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"So am I, my dear," and Madame Lafond
took from behind a copper saucepan hanging
on the wall a bag of money, from which she
took some coins and put the bag back again
in this queer money-box. She then placed the
basket of strawberries on their bed of green
leaves on her arm, and she, Germaine, and
Raton set off.</p>

<p>Madame Lafond had on a neat black dress,
very short, and gathered full around the waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and a blue apron. Her hair was brushed back
under her white cap, and on her feet she wore
<i>sabots</i>, the wooden shoes all the working people
in the country wear.</p>

<p>Germaine's dress was her mother's in miniature,
and her little <i>sabots</i> clacked as she ran
down the road, carrying in her hand a pot
holding a flower, carefully wrapped about with
white paper for M. Auguste. It was a beautiful
walk through the fields and apple orchards,
into the road, shaded by old trees that led to
the top of the hill, and then down the hillside
past the old Château Gaillard; that wonderful
castle whose history Germaine never wearied
of hearing.</p>

<p>It seemed to her like a fairy-tale that such
things could have happened so near her papa's
farm, though it all took place many hundreds
of years ago, when there was nothing but wild
woods where now stands their farm and those
of their neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The château was built by the great Norman
who became an English king. He was known
as Richard the Lion-hearted, because he was
so brave and fearless. Perhaps our little English
cousins will remember him best by this
romantic story. Once King Richard was imprisoned
by his enemies, no one knew where;
his friends had given him up for lost&mdash;all but
his faithful court musician Blondel, who went
from castle to castle, the length and breadth of
Europe, singing the favourite songs that he and
his royal master had sung together. One day
his devotion was rewarded, for, while singing
under the windows of a castle in Austria, he
heard a voice join with his, and he knew he had
found his master.</p>

<p>At that time France was not the big country
it is now. Normandy belonged to the English
Crown, and the Kings of France were always
trying to conquer it for their own.</p>

<p>So Richard built this strong fortress on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
river Seine, at the most important point where
the dominion of France joined that of Normandy.
He planned it all himself, and, it is
said, even helped to put up the stones with his
own hands. It was begun and finished in one
year, and when the last stone was placed in
the big central tower, King Richard cried out:
"Behold my beautiful daughter of a year."
Then he named it Château Gaillard, which is
the French for "Saucy Castle," and stood on
its high walls and defied the French king,
Philippe-Auguste, who was encamped across
the river, to come and take it from him,&mdash;just
as a naughty boy puts a chip on his
shoulder and dares another boy to knock it
off. Well, the French king took his dare,
but he also took care to wait until the great,
brave Richard had been killed by an arrow in
warfare. Then for five months he and his
army besieged the castle, and a desperate fight
it was on both sides. At last the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
forced an entrance. After that, for several
hundred years, its story was one of bloody
deeds and fierce fights, until another French
king, Henri IV., practically destroyed it, in
order to show his power over the Norman
barons whom he feared; and so it stands to-day
only a big ruin&mdash;but one of the most
splendid in France.</p>

<p>Germaine often wondered why it was called
"Saucy," for it did not look so to her now.
The big central tower with its broken windows
seemed to her like an old face, with half-shut
eyes and great yawning mouth, weary with
its struggles, leaning with a tired air against the
few jagged walls that still stood around it.</p>

<p>But it looked very grand for all that, and
Germaine was fond of it, and she with her
cousin Jean often played about its crumbling
walls. Jean would stand in the great broken
window and play he was one of the archers of
King Richard's time, with a big bow six feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
long in his hand, and arrows at his belt, and
that he was watching for the enemy who
always travelled by the river, for in those days
there were few roads, and journeying by boat
on the river was the most convenient way to
come and go.</p>

<p>There is no finer outlook in all France than
from King Richard's castle at Petit Andelys,
for one can look ten miles up the river on one
side and ten miles down on the other. Thus
no one could go from France into Normandy
without being seen by the watchman on the
tower of the Château Gaillard. Three hundred
feet below is the tiny village of Petit Andelys,
looking like a lot of toy houses.</p>

<p>As they entered the main street of the village,
Madame Lafond stopped at the <i>Octroi</i>, to
pay the tax on her strawberries. All towns in
France put a tax on all produce brought into
the town, and for this purpose there is a small
building at each entrance to the town where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
every one must stop and declare what they
have, and pay the small tax accordingly.</p>

<p>"I hear the '<i>Appariteur</i>,'" said Germaine,
as they walked down the narrow cobble-paved
street, "I wonder what he is calling out."
The "<i>Appariteur</i>" is a sort of town-crier, who
makes the announcements of interest to the
neighbourhood by going along the streets
beating a drum and crying out his news, while
the people run to the windows and doors to
listen. It takes the place of a daily newspaper
to some extent, and costs nothing to the
public.</p>

<p>They were soon at the Hôtel Belle Étoile,
and found stout, good-natured M. Auguste at
the entrance, seeing some of his guests off.
He was delighted with the strawberries, and
when Germaine gave him the bouquet of
flowers, with a pretty little speech of congratulation
for his birthday, he kissed her, French
fashion, on both cheeks, and took them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the café, where he gave them a sweet fruit-syrup
to drink. It is always the custom
among our French cousins to offer some kind
of refreshment on every possible occasion, and
especially on a visit of ceremony such as this.
So when M. Auguste asked Madame Lafond
what she would take, she and Germaine chose
a "<i>Sirop de Groseilles</i>," which is made of the
juice of gooseberries and sweetened. A few
spoonfuls of this in a glass of soda-water
makes a delightful cool drink in hot weather,
and one of which French children are very
fond. There are also syrups made in the
same way from strawberries, raspberries,
peaches, etc., but this is one of the best
liked.</p>

<p>"There is Madeleine making signs to you
outside the door. Run and see what she
wants, my little one," said M. Auguste. "I
can guess," he said, laughingly, as Germaine
ran to greet the waitress of the hotel, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
always looked so neat and pretty in her white
country cap, her coloured apron over a black
dress, and a coloured handkerchief around
her neck, with neat black slippers on her
feet.</p>

<p>"Let me show you how we are going to
celebrate the fête-day of M. Auguste," said
she, smiling, and, opening a box, she showed
Germaine the sticks of powder, which they
would burn when night came, and make the
beautiful red and green light such as all children
and many grown folks like. The first
of these sticks was to be burnt at the very
entrance door, that all the village might
know that it was M. Auguste's birthday.
Madeleine and the cook and the housemaid
and the washerwoman and the boy that
blacked the guests' boots had each given a few
centimes (or cents) to buy these, as well as
other things that wriggled along the ground
and went off with a bang, as a surprise for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
M. Auguste. Also the American and English
visitors at the hotel had bought "Roman
candles" and some "catharine-wheels," which
were to be let off in front of the Belle Étoile;
so the hotel would be very gay that night.</p>

<p>M. Auguste's name-day had also been celebrated
in another way some time before. On
the fête of St. Auguste it was the custom to
carry around a big anvil and stop with it in
front of the house of every one who is named
Auguste or Augustine. A cartridge was
placed on the anvil and hit sharply with a
hammer, when of course it made a frightful
noise; and for some unknown reason this was
supposed to please good St. Auguste as well
as those who bore his name. Then the person
who had this little attention paid him or
her would come out and ask every one into
their house to have a glass of <i>calvados</i>, which
is a favourite drink in this part of France,
and is made from apples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The Belle Étoile, like most of the hotels
of France, was built with a courtyard in the
centre, and around this were galleries or verandas,
on which the sleeping-rooms opened.
Carriages passed through an archway into this
courtyard, on the one side of which were
stables, on another the kitchen and servants'
quarters, and the entrance to the big cellar
where were kept the great barrels of cider.</p>

<p>Most of the courtyard was given up to a
beautiful garden, set about with shrubs and
flowers. At little tables under big, gay, striped
garden-umbrellas, the guests of the Belle
Étoile ate their meals. In the country, every
one who can dines in the garden during the
summer months, which is another pleasant
custom of this people.</p>

<p>M. Auguste was very fond of little Germaine,
and often told her of his boyhood days
in the gay little city of Tours, where the purest
French is spoken, with its fine old cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and the lovely country thereabouts all covered
with grape-vines; and how in the bright
autumn days the vineyards are full of workers
filling the baskets on their backs with the green
and purple grapes; how late in the evening the
big wagons, full of men, women, and children,
come rolling home, piled up with grapes, the
pickers all singing and joyous, with great
bunches of wild flowers tied on the front of
each wagon. "A very happy, gay people,
my dear," would remark M. Auguste, "not
like these cold, stolid Normans." But to us
foreigners all the French people seem as gay
as these good folk of Touraine, the land of
vineyards and beautiful white châteaux.</p>

<p>M. Auguste had also been a great traveller,
for his father was well-to-do, and he thought
that his boy should see something of his own
country&mdash;though French people as a rule are
not great travellers. They are the most home-loving
people in the world, and their greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ambition is to have a little house and a garden
in which to spend their days.</p>

<p>So M. Auguste had seen much. He had
been to the bustling city of Lyons, where the
finest silks and velvets in the world are made.
He had journeyed along the beautiful coast of
France where it borders on the blue Mediterranean,
where palms and oranges and such
lovely flowers grow, especially the sweet purple
violets from which the perfumes are made.
From here also come the candied rose-petals
and violets, that the confectioners sell you as
the latest thing in sweetmeats.</p>

<p>He had visited the great port of Marseilles,
the most important in France, where are to be
seen ships from all over the world, and there
he learned to make their famous dish, the
<i>bouillabaisse</i>, which is a luscious stew of all
kinds of fish&mdash;for M. Auguste prides himself
on the special dishes that he cooks for his
guests, and Germaine is often asked to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
them. He had been also to the rich city of
Bordeaux, where the fine wines come from.
Oh, M. Auguste is a great traveller, thought
Germaine, as they sat together in the kitchen
of the Belle Étoile, while M. Auguste talked
with Mimi, the white cat, sitting on his shoulder,
while Fifine, the black one, was on his
knee. They were great pets of M. Auguste,
and as well known and liked as himself by the
guests at the Belle Étoile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>TO ROUEN ON A BARGE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Germaine</span> and her parents, and her Uncle
Daboll and his wife, and their little son Jean,
just one year younger than Germaine, were all
at the station long before the train was due.
The two children were fairly prancing with
glee, while Raton leaped about no less excited.
They were very fond of Marie, as was every
one who knew her, for she was a gentle, kind-hearted
girl, and though several years older
than Germaine, they were great companions.
This was her first year away from home, and
Germaine had missed her sadly.</p>

<p>"There she is," cried Germaine, as the train
pulled slowly in, and a young girl appeared at
the window of one of the third-class carriages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
waving her handkerchief, and throwing them
kisses.</p>

<p>Her father lifted her down, and every one
kissed her twice, on either cheek, and amid
much laughing and talking they walked toward
Uncle Daboll's house, while Raton danced
in circles about them as if he had gone mad.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie," cried Germaine and Jean in
the same breath, "we have such a lovely surprise
for you! You have heard, of course, of
the grand 'Norman Fêtes,' which are to be
held at Rouen next week! Well, just think,
we are all going to see them, that is, you and
Jean and me and uncle and aunt, and better
still&mdash;how do you think we are going?"
"Why, on the train, of course," laughed Marie,
"and won't we have a good time." "No,"
spoke up Jean, quickly, "we are going a brand-new
way. What do you say to going on a
barge on the river?" "A barge," cried Marie,
"but I thought no one was allowed to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
on the barges, except the people who ran them
and lived on them." "That is true," said
Germaine, "but uncle has fixed all that; you
know he sends lots of brick to Rouen by
the barges&mdash;one is being loaded up now at
the quay, and he has arranged that we go on it
to Rouen and stay on the barge while it is being
unloaded, and see the fêtes. Then we will
come back by train. Won't it be glorious?"
"And," chimed in Jean, "papa is going to tell
us all about the history of these fêtes after
dinner."</p>

<p>M. Daboll's home was a neat little cottage,
with its upper part of black beams and white
plaster, and a pretty red-tiled roof, the ground
floor being of stone. M. Daboll owned a
large brick-kiln, and was quite well-to-do.</p>

<p>They all gathered for dinner about a round
table in an arbour that overlooked the river.
The arbour was ingeniously formed by training
the branches of two trees and interlacing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as if they were vines, which gave complete
shelter from the sun.</p>

<p>Every one was eager to listen to Marie's
account of her school life at the convent. It
was a very old convent, with beautiful gardens
surrounding it, built as usual around a courtyard,
in the centre of which was a statue of
St. Antoine, who is a favourite patron saint
of schools, and considered the special guardian
of children. He also, according to tradition,
helps one find lost articles, and as we all know
how school-children are always losing their
belongings, this may be another reason for
having the kind St. Antoine as a protector
of school-children. At six the girls are up,
and study an hour before the "little breakfast"
of a roll and butter and chocolate or coffee.
Lessons take up the time until noon, when
they have their dinner of soup, meat, vegetable,
and cider, with a <i>gâteau</i>, as they call a
cake, on Sundays. After dinner they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
taught plain sewing, and when the sewing hour
is over they can play about the gardens until
the study hour comes around again. A plain
supper of bread and cheese, chocolate or milk,
follows, and by nine o'clock every one is in
bed. The children dress very simply,&mdash;plain
cotton frocks, which indoors are always completely
covered with a black apron or <i>tablier</i>.
On Thursdays they have a half-holiday, and
in the care of the Sisters go on little excursions
or walks in the neighbourhood. A pleasant,
simple life, and, as M. Lafond said, as he
pinched Marie's cheek, "It seems to agree
with you, my dear."</p>

<p>"Now, papa, you promised to tell us about
these Norman Fêtes," said Jean, when the
table had been cleared away, and the little
coffee-cups brought out.</p>

<p>"So I will, Jean, and first you bring me
that big roll which you will find on the side-table
in the dining-room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Jean was back with it directly, and Uncle
Daboll unrolled a big poster, advertising the
fêtes. It showed a fine, strong man in ancient
armour, seated on a prancing horse, carrying
on his arm a shield, emblazoned with two red
lions, and holding aloft a spear. Below him
on the river were to be seen three small boats,
each with one sail, and also arranged so that it
could be rowed by hand.</p>

<p>"This represents Rollo," went on M. Daboll,
as the children clustered around him,
"the leader of a great race of people whose
home was in the cold, far-away North. Tall
people they were, with golden hair, and great
sailors, who sailed in tiny ships, like those you
see in the picture, over the bleak, stormy sea
which lies between their land and France, until
they came to the river Seine, where it empties
into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>"They rowed up the river and camped
where the fine city of Rouen now stands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and from these fair-haired Northmen are descended
the present-day Normans. It has
been many centuries since all this happened,
so the good people of Rouen thought this a
suitable time to celebrate the founding of their
city, and of the great Norman race, at one
time the most powerful in France."</p>

<p>"And at Rouen we shall also see the spot
where poor Jeanne d'Arc was burned," said
Marie. "We have just been reading her
history at the school."</p>

<p>"Tell us her story again," said Jean.</p>

<p>"She will on the barge. You will have
plenty of time then," said M. Lafond; "but
we must be getting home now. It is quite a
walk, and our little Marie must be tired after
her long day."</p>

<p>It was about six o'clock in the morning of
the next day when the gay little party found
themselves on the barge bound for Rouen.</p>

<p>"Now here comes our tow that we must tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
up to," said the bargeman, as a tug with five
barges in tow came puffing down the river;
and taking a long pole with a hook in the end
of it, he began pushing the barge away from
the shore until it moved toward the middle of
the river. Then the tugboat slowed down
until the long line of barges was just creeping
along; one could hardly see that they moved
at all. Just as the last one passed that which
carried our party, the man in the stern of it
threw them a rope which was quickly caught
and fastened to the forward end, and as it
grew taut, the barge began to move and
soon took its place at the tail-end of the long
procession.</p>

<p>The children at once began to make themselves
at home in their new surroundings.
"Did you ever see anything nicer?" said Germaine,
as she dragged Marie into the little
house under the big tiller, where the bargeman
and his wife lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does it not look like a doll's house?"
said Marie, as they went down the ladder into
the tiny living room. Everything was as neat
as could be, and painted white, with lace curtains
at each of the small windows.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how much could be stowed
away inside, and yet leave plenty of room.
A sewing-machine stood in one corner; a bird-cage
was hanging in the window, and a little
stove, a table to dine on, and a couple of
chairs completed the arrangements, save the
pictures on the walls, the china in a neat little
cupboard, and the beds which were built like
shelves, one above the other, to allow all the
floor space possible. On deck, one side of
the house was given up to a shelf full of gay
flowers in pots, and vines were trained up
against the side of the house. There was
also on deck a chest to hold the meat and
vegetables, so as to keep them cool and fresh,
and a small cask was made into a house for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the dog. Every barge has its dog and cat,
which usually get on together very well, considering
their crowded quarters. Everything
about the house end of the barge was painted
white with green trimmings, and all was very
clean and neat.</p>

<p>Jean then came up to tell them that he had
found out that every barge in the tow belonged
to a different owner. This he had learned
from the gaudy colours with which they were
decorated. "You will see," said he, "that ours
has a big white triangle with a smaller red triangle
inside of that painted on the bow. The
one next to us has a broad red band with two
white circles, and there is another yellow with
two big blue stars on either side. These are
the distinguishing marks of the different companies
to which they belong."</p>

<p>They were now leaving behind them the
great high cliffs of white chalk that shine like
snow, through which the river runs almost all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the way from Mantes to Rouen. Just here
it wound through rich green meadows. Along
the water's edge were clumps of willow-trees,
whose long, pliable twigs are used by the
country people to weave baskets. They trim
off the branches, but leave the tree standing
for more branches to grow, and so they never
use up their basket material. The French
take very good care of their trees, and when
they cut one down, always plant another in its
place.</p>

<p>Often the barge passed other long tows,
whose barge-people would shout greetings
across to them. For most <i>bargees</i> are acquainted,
at least by sight, and the dogs would
bark "How do you do's" as well. Great
coal barges from Belgium passed, having come
laden many hundreds of miles across France;
and others with hogsheads of wine from the
south, which have been brought by sea to
Rouen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>A merry dinner was served on a table on
deck under an awning. The wife of the bargeman
had cooked a good meal on the little
stove which stood on one of the hatches right
out in the open. They had a favourite country
soup first, beef and cabbage soup with a
crust of bread in it. (French soups are usually
called <i>potage</i>, though the real country soup is
often known by the name we call it ourselves&mdash;<i>soupe</i>.)
Then there was a crisp green salad,
big jugs of Normandy cider, which is a beautiful
golden colour, <i>blanquette de veau</i>, which
is veal with a nice white egg sauce over it.
<i>Lapin garnne</i> followed, which is nothing more
than stewed rabbit, and a dish of which all
French people are very fond, and have nearly
every day when it is in season. Fresh Normandy
cream cheese and cherries and little
cakes finished the meal, with the usual coffee
and <i>calvados</i> for the older people.</p>

<p>"We will soon see Pont de l'Arche," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the bargeman, and they had barely finished
dinner when the picturesque church of the
town was seen rising above the trees.</p>

<p>"It has no spire nor towers; it looks like
half of a church," said Jean.</p>

<p>"Which is true, but it is quite a famous
church, nevertheless," said his father. "It is
probably the only church in the world which
is dedicated to 'Art and to the Artists.'"</p>

<p>"Our Lady of the Arts" it is called.
Artists are beginning to visit it more from
year to year, and it is a veritable place of
pilgrimage now.</p>

<p>The barge soon passed under the old bridge
at Pont de l'Arche, and left behind the church,
standing high above the town, a landmark for
miles along the river.</p>

<p>Marie had promised to tell the children the
story of Jeanne d'Arc, as they wanted to have
it fresh in their minds when they visited
Rouen, for every part of this old city is full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of memories of this wonderful little peasant
girl who saved her country, and, by so doing,
made possible the existence of the great French
nation of to-day.</p>

<p>Sitting under the awning, as the barge glided
along, Marie told the story of the little peasant
girl, only sixteen years old, who lived in
the far-away village of Domremy. Believing
that Heaven had chosen her to save her country
from the hands of the English, she made
her way to the court of Charles VII., then
King of France. It was at Chinon in the
valley of the Loire&mdash;that other great river of
France&mdash;that she finally reached her king,
and in one of the great castles, whose ruins
still crown the heights above the city, eloquently
pleaded her cause. Visitors there to-day
can see the room with its great fireplace
in which this famous meeting took place.</p>

<p>Her plea convinced the king, and she was
made commander-in-chief of the army, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
she led on to Orleans, raised the siege of that
city, and drove the English off. There is to-day
no city in France as proud of the "Maid"
as is Orleans; indeed she is known as the
"Maid of Orleans." The house she is supposed
to have stayed in is now preserved as a
museum, and every May, on the anniversary
of the day on which the siege was raised, a
great celebration takes place in front of the
cathedral, and a procession of priests and people
carrying banners marches around the town
chanting hymns in her praise. Jeanne d'Arc
did break the power of the English in France,
true to her promise, and finally brought King
Charles to the magnificent cathedral at Reims,
where the French kings were always crowned,
and herself, amid great rejoicing, placed the
crown upon his head. But the king forgot
what the "Maid" had done for him and for
his country, apparently, and finally she was
betrayed into the hands of her enemies, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
took her to Rouen, and, after a mock trial,
poor Jeanne was sentenced to death, and burnt
in the market-place at Rouen.</p>

<p>In later years the French nation recognized
the great good she had done, and the memory
of the little peasant girl of Domremy is loved
and venerated throughout the land. There is
scarcely a city in France that has not honoured
her in some way, either by erecting a statue to
her, or naming a <i>place</i> or street in her honour.</p>

<p>The children were so much interested in the
wonderful story of Jeanne d'Arc that they had
not realized how time was flying. They were
drawing near Rouen, for over the flat fields of
the river valley on the left rose the tall chimneys
of the cotton factories at Oissel and
Elbeuf.</p>

<p>There is much cotton cloth made in the
vicinity of Rouen, and shipped all over France.
On the quays there may be seen the bales of
cotton that is grown on the plantations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Southern States of America, and shipped from
New Orleans direct to Rouen.</p>

<p>Just here the bargeman pointed out to them
the tiny church of St. Adrien. The "Rock
Church," as it is known, is cut out of the
chalk cliff, hanging high above the river. It
looks like a bird's house perched up so high,
with its four small windows and tiny bell-tower.</p>

<p>Presently Uncle Daboll said, "Look way
down the river, children, and tell me what you
see."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Jean, "I see three church
spires."</p>

<p>"More than that," said Germaine. "I can
count seven."</p>

<p>"Both of you are right," said Uncle Daboll.
"The three spires are those of three of the
most beautiful churches in France. That tall,
needle-like one belongs to the Cathedral of
Notre Dame."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="long line of boats" />
<div class="caption">"THE CITY BEGAN TO UNFOLD BEFORE THEM"</div>
</div>

<p>"There is one which looks as if it has a
crown on the top," said Germaine.</p>

<p>"It does look like a crown made of stone,
and so it has been called the 'Crown of Normandy.'
It is on the central tower of the
church of St. Ouen."</p>

<p>The city began to unfold before them, with
its long rows of quays lined with shops, hotels,
and cafés on the one side, and ships from all
parts of the world on the other.</p>

<p>Their barge soon deftly glided into what
seemed a perfect tangle of barges of all kinds,
and came to anchor next to a big Belgian coal-carrier,
whose occupants, like themselves, were
evidently bent on getting as much enjoyment
out of their visit to Rouen as possible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>THE FÊTES AT ROUEN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was growing dark when our little party
scrambled over the decks of several barges,
and finally found themselves walking up the
quay.</p>

<p>The lights were beginning to twinkle in all
directions, and in a few minutes the river and
city were ablaze. It seemed like fairyland to
the children. The bridges were outlined with
golden globes and festoons of tiny lamps of
red, white, and blue. Wreaths of lights, in
the shape of flowers of all colours, made innumerable
arches of light across the streets.
Everywhere were flags grouped about shields
on which were the letters R. F., which stand
for the words "Republic of France."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Walking in any direction was not easy. A
mass of people swaying hither and thither
blocked streets, bridges, and quays. Our
little Les Andelys party did not attempt to
stem the torrent. "We will just drift along,"
said Uncle Daboll, "and see what we can, and
you children hold each other's hands and keep
closely to us."</p>

<p>It was a motley and most good-natured
crowd. Ladies in Parisian gowns mingled
with country women in their fanciful white
caps, kerchiefs, and short skirts. There were
Breton fisherfolk and dark-skinned people
from the far south; sailors and soldiers in
their gay red and blue uniforms, and every
now and then one would hear a clear English
voice.</p>

<p>Vendors of toys for the little ones, and
souvenirs for everybody, stood on every corner
and did a flourishing trade, and high above the
heads of every one floated masses of the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
red, white, and blue balloons, held captive on a
long string, without which no French fête is
complete. On the sidewalk in front of the
cafés, people were sitting at small tables sipping
their coffee and the numberless sweet drinks
of which the French are so fond, while at each
café a band was playing for the amusement of
its guests, but was also enjoyed by the passing
throngs. It took the combined efforts of
many natty policemen&mdash;"<i>gendarmes</i>," they are
called&mdash;to keep an open pathway through the
crowd.</p>

<p>A <i>gendarme</i> looks more like a soldier than a
policeman, in his dark blue uniform and soldier-cap,
a short sword by his side, and a cape over
his shoulders, all of which gives him quite a
military air.</p>

<p>Presently, at a corner, they were stopped by
an even denser throng who were watching a
gaily dressed crowd of people entering a brilliantly
decorated and illuminated building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is this?" asked Uncle Daboll of a
man near him.</p>

<p>"It is the grand costume ball at the theatre,
where every one is expected to dress in old
Norman costume," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Germaine, "that is why the
ladies are wearing those funny tall head-dresses;
look, Marie, there is one quite near us."</p>

<p>The costume was both pretty and odd. The
lady had on a white head-dress made of embroidered
muslin, very like a sunbonnet in
shape, with a high crown, around which was
tied a big bow of ribbon. A bright-coloured
kerchief was about her neck, and she wore a
square-necked cloth bodice neatly laced in
front, with sleeves to the elbow; underneath
this was a white <i>chemisette</i>, as it is called.
Around the neck and sleeves of the bodice
were bands of velvet. A very short skirt,
gathered as full as possible about the waist, a
dainty little apron of coloured silk with lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
insertion, wooden <i>sabots</i>, prettily carved, and
lace mitts on her hands, completed her unusual
costume.</p>

<p>The gentleman with her was also in Norman
dress. He had big baggy trousers, a high
velvet waistcoat embroidered in bright colours,
a short round jacket with gold buttons, a high
white collar with a big red silk handkerchief
tied in a bow around the neck, enormous <i>sabots</i>,
and all topped off with a high silk hat, with a
straight brim.</p>

<p>While the children were busy looking at the
details of the costumes, a carriage halted so
near Germaine that she could have put out her
hand and touched its occupant, who was a
young girl about her own age. Germaine was
at once attracted to her. She had a sweet
pretty face, bright rosy cheeks, and soft blue
eyes; her waving, brown hair fell loosely about
her shoulders, and across her white dress was
draped a small silk flag which Germaine recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as the British flag, known as the "<i>Union
Jack</i>." She wore a wreath of red roses and
carried in her hand a bunch of the same flowers
in which were stuck two small silk flags&mdash;one
French and the other British. Beside her sat
a portly gentleman in a gorgeous robe of black
and red trimmed with fur, while around his
neck was a massive golden chain.</p>

<p>As Germaine was watching her, the little
girl leaned eagerly out of the carriage window,
and in so doing dropped her bouquet at Germaine's
feet. "Oh, papa, I have lost my
flowers," she cried. Meanwhile Germaine
quickly picked them up, and handed them
back to her; and not a moment too soon, for
the carriage was moving on again and the bouquet
would have been crushed under its wheels.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," cried the little girl,
looking back and waving her hand. Germaine
did not understand the words, but knew she
had been thanked in English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Germaine had been so taken up with this
little incident that she had not noticed that the
crowd had separated her from her companions.
Her heart gave a bound, and with a startled
cry she realized that only strange faces were
about her, and she stood motionless with
fright. Her terror was fortunately short-lived,
for through the crowd she saw Uncle Daboll
making his way toward her, and rushing up to
him thankfully clasped his hand, which he
made her promise not to loose again until they
were safe back on the barge.</p>

<p>It was not until later, when they were sitting
on the deck of the barge watching the fireworks
on the heights around the city leave
fiery streaks and showers of shining stars on
the blackness of the summer sky, that Germaine
had the opportunity of telling the family
of her adventure with the "little girl of the
roses," as she called her.</p>

<p>Aunt Daboll thought that probably she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
belonged to one of the parties of English visitors
who had come to Rouen to take part in
the Fêtes.</p>

<p>Very early the following morning they
finished their coffee and rolls and began their
round of sightseeing, all of which had to be
crowded into the morning, as the afternoon was
to be given over to the Water Tournament,
to which the children were looking forward
with great excitement.</p>

<p>Jean, especially, had been impressed with
the posters which showed in brilliant colours
men in unfamiliar dress, tumbling into the
water and being fished out again, with, apparently,
great unconcern as to the consequences.</p>

<p>"Well, what shall we see first?" asked
Uncle Daboll.</p>

<p>"Oh, the big clock," said Jean, "and
then let's climb the iron spire of the cathedral."</p>

<p>Germaine wanted to see where poor Jeanne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
d'Arc had been put to death; the others were
ready for anything.</p>

<p>"Everywhere one sees the name of Jeanne
d'Arc," said Marie. "This street is named
after her, and last night we were in the
Boulevard Jeanne d'Arc."</p>

<p>"And just at the top of this same street,"
said Uncle Daboll, "we shall see the Tower
of Jeanne d'Arc, where the poor girl was imprisoned
during her mock trial in the great
castle, of which only this one tower is left
standing."</p>

<p>They soon turned into a narrow street, and
there was the great clock, built in a tower,
under which runs the roadway itself.</p>

<p>Another turning brought them to the Palais
de Justice, with its big dormer windows elaborately
carved in stone.</p>

<p>A few steps more, and they were in the old
market-place, and little Germaine with bated
breath looked at the stone let into the pavement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
at her feet, which marks the spot where
poor Jeanne bravely met her terrible death by
fire. All about the place the market people
were peddling their wares, bargaining and calling
out the merits of their various vegetables
and fruits and poultry, the scene not unlike
what it may have been in those olden days
when the Normans ruled.</p>

<p>Our party could not, however, linger very
long over memories of the "Maid," for Uncle
Daboll hurried them away to see the great
church of St. Ouen, with such large windows
that it seems to have walls of glass, and its
curious Portal of the Marmosets, all over
which are carved little animals which look like
ferrets. They passed the little church of St.
Maclou, set like a gem in a tangle of streets
that were little more than alleys. As Jean
said, the tall, old houses seemed to be leaning
over toward one another as if they were trying
to knock their heads together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At one street corner there had been erected
a triumphal arch which was surmounted by a
facsimile of the statue of William the Conqueror,
the original of which stands in the
little Norman town of Falaise, where he was
born.</p>

<p>All French children know the history of
this great Norman, who was an unknown boy
in an obscure little village, but who in time
sailed across what is now known as the English
Channel, conquered England, and made himself
King of England as well as Duke of
Normandy.</p>

<p>When they came to the cathedral, our party
were glad to enter and rest awhile within the
cool, lofty aisles and say a short prayer.</p>

<p>Marie remembered her favourite St. Antoine
and dropped two sous in the box at the foot
of his statue, for the poor.</p>

<p>While Uncle Daboll and Jean climbed up
the iron spire, the rest of the party were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
by the "<i>suisse</i>" to see the chapels with their
tombs and tapestries.</p>

<p>The <i>suisse</i> is an imposing person in gorgeous
dress of black velvet and gold lace, a big three-cornered
hat covered with gold braid, white
silk stockings, shoes with big buckles, and he
carries a tall gold-headed stock.</p>

<p>It is his duty to guard the church and, for a
small fee, to show visitors the chapels and
other parts of the church not generally open.</p>

<p>Marie and Germaine felt quite in awe of
him at first. They had never seen anything
so magnificent before, but seeing their great
interest in all that he pointed out to them, he
unbent, and when he showed Germaine the
spot where was buried the heart of King
Richard, and she told him that she lived near
the great castle the king had built, at Les
Andelys, he smiled in a most friendly way, and
patted her on the head.</p>

<p>It was quite a change when, after Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Daboll and Jean joined them, they went out
from the dark church into the square blazing
with sunlight, and full of booths with all sorts
of things to sell, toys, souvenirs, and picture
post-cards galore.</p>

<p>Jean was full of his experiences in the
tower: how they went up a little winding
stairway to the very top, and they could see
for miles around the city, and how the people
looked like tiny black dots far below; and
how, when coming down, he got a bit dizzy,
and his father made him shut his eyes and sit
still for a minute or two; but that was doing
better than a grown man who was just behind
them, and who had to go back just after
they had started.</p>

<p>When Jean had finished telling his experiences,
everybody found out that they were
very hungry. Uncle Daboll laughed, and
said he had never known them to be so much
of one mind before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, follow me, little ones, and we shall
find something," he said, and led the way
down the street, gay with flags, wreaths, and
flowers.</p>

<p>"Just one moment, uncle," cried Marie, "let
us stop and buy some post-cards to send home."</p>

<p>"It will be better," said Uncle Daboll, "to
get them after dinner, and while we are having
our coffee at a café we can write them and send
them off. If we stop now, we shall be late
for dinner, for it is past noon."</p>

<p>"Here is our place for dinner," he continued,
as they entered a small square surrounded
by old-time houses near the river.
On one side was a modest little hotel called
the "Three Merchants." Going up an outside
stairway, they entered a small room
with a low ceiling and a stone floor, with a
long table down the centre.</p>

<p>It was a typical place for the farmers to
come for their dinners when they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
their produce into the markets. Some of
these farmers were now sitting at the table
with blue or black blouses over their broadcloth
suits, with their wives in black dresses
and white caps, all talking and gesticulating
away over their dinner.</p>

<p>There were two pleasant-faced curés in their
long, tight black gowns closely buttoned up the
front, the brims of their flat black hats caught
up on either side with a cord, who had evidently
come in from some country parish to
see the fêtes. There was also a solitary
bicyclist whose costume betrayed the fact that
he was a Frenchman, for no other bicyclists in
the world get themselves up in so juvenile a
manner as do the French. A loose black
alpaca coat, a broad waistband in which was
sewed his purse, baggy knickerbockers of gray
plaid, and socks with low shoes, leaving the
leg bare to the knee, completed his marvellous
costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>You would think this a little boy's dress in
America, would you not?</p>

<p>These were the guests to whom our party
nodded, which is a polite and universal French
custom when entering and leaving a room
where others are, even though they may be
unknown to you.</p>

<p>After a bountiful middle-class dinner, our
party passed out into the crowded streets
again, when the energetic Jean exclaimed:
"Now for our post-cards!"</p>

<p>"Now for a place to rest a little while,"
cried uncle and aunt in the same breath.</p>

<p>"Here is a pleasant, cool-looking little café
across the street; the one with the green
shrubs in boxes before it. We will have
our coffee there while you select your post-cards.
You will find them in that corner
shop."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the children were back
with the cards. Jean had selected a view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the cathedral, because he wanted to show his
uncle and aunt the great spire up which he
had climbed; Marie sent several showing the
decorations in the streets to various of her
school friends, and Germaine did not forget
her friend, M. Auguste, after sending one each
to her father and mother.</p>

<p>Before two o'clock everybody was hurrying
toward the river to see the water sports.</p>

<p>"Oh, aunty," cried Germaine, pulling her
aunt by the sleeve, "look, there is my 'little
girl of the roses,' see, walking this way with
those ladies and gentlemen!"</p>

<p>Germaine was quite trembling with excitement
as she saw the little girl recognized her,
and came quickly toward them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to see you," she cried.
"I have wanted to see you again to thank
you. Oh, but isn't it stupid of me?" she went
on, with a sign of vexation. "Of course you
don't know English, and I can't speak French,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
except to say <i>merci</i> and <i>bon jour</i> and <i>bon soir</i>,
so how can we talk to each other?" Then
she stopped and laughed, and Germaine
laughed, too, and the two little girls stood
smiling at one another, when the portly gentleman,
whom Germaine had seen in the carriage,
hurried up. "Ethel, my dear, why did
you run off like this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, this is the little girl who handed
me back my roses, when they fell from the
carriage last night. You know my special
programme was tied with the flowers, and I
would not have lost it for anything."</p>

<p>Just then some French people came up who
also spoke English, and the little girl explained
the situation. Germaine then learned that
Ethel was the daughter of the mayor of the
English town of Hastings, and he had been
invited to represent England at the fêtes, for
it was at Hastings that William the Conqueror
had landed, and near there that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
great battle of Hastings was fought, which
gave England to the Normans.</p>

<p>That was so very long ago that everybody
in England is now very proud of it, and the
English cousins from Hastings were taking
as much interest in the fêtes as the French
themselves.</p>

<p>Germaine blushed while the gentleman was
telling her all this, and Ethel took a little
English flag that she had pinned on her dress
and gave it to Germaine. When Ethel's
papa heard where Germaine lived, he said he
had been to Les Andelys, he had stayed at
the Belle Étoile, and knew M. Auguste, and
perhaps next year he would come there again
and bring Ethel and her mother, and then
they should all meet again.</p>

<p>After the French gentleman kindly made
all this known to Germaine, the little girls
shook hands and parted, for the Tournament
had begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Two queer-looking craft, much like gondolas,
took up their positions, one at either
end of the course. The crew of one had a
white costume with red sashes and red caps&mdash;the
other was in similar dress, except that their
caps and sashes were blue. These respective
crews were known as the "Blues" and the
"Reds."</p>

<p>On a raised platform at the end of his boat
stood a "Red," with a long lance at rest;
opposite was a "Blue" in the same position.
At a given signal, the boats came toward one
another, and one lance-man attempted to push
the other off into the water.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement among their partisans
on the banks, and cries of encouragement
came from friends on either side. Jean had
picked out the "Blue" as his choice, while
Marie and Germaine hoped the "Red" would
win. By this time the children were standing
on their chairs, Jean waving his cap with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
great enthusiasm. Suddenly "Red" gave a
stronger push, and down went poor "Blue,"
head foremost in the water. However, he did
not seem to mind it, as he sat dripping in the
rescue boat. Jean felt rather badly over the
fall of his hero, but another man took his
place, and this time Jean's man won, to his
intense delight. So the fun went on until late
in the afternoon. Another evening's walk
through the illuminated city, and the children
were quite ready for their beds on the barge,&mdash;for
the men of the party slept on deck
while the rest had the little house to themselves.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>GOING HOME BY TRAIN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with real regret that our little friends
parted from the good barge people and their
floating home, as well as from the beautiful
city of Rouen, where they had seen so much,
and had such a good time.</p>

<p>Germaine, who had not been before in a big
railway station, was somewhat bewildered at
the confusion about her, while Jean, who had
been once to Mantes, was proud to be able to
explain things to her. The tall man in a blue
uniform was the station-master, and one could
always tell him from the other blue-uniformed
officials, because he wore a white cap. It was
his duty to send off the trains, which he does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by blowing a small whistle, after which some
one rings a hand-bell that sounds like a dinner-bell,
and off goes the train.</p>

<p>The men who were pushing luggage around
on small hand-trucks were the porters, in blue
blouses like any French working man, except
they were belted in at the waist by a broad
band of red and black stripes.</p>

<p>Presently the station-master whistled off
their train. "Keep a sharp lookout," said
Uncle Daboll, "and, as soon as we leave this
tunnel we are now going through, look out on
the right side and you will have a fine view of
the city."</p>

<p>Sure enough, in a few minutes they were on
the bridge, crossing the river, and before them
stretched out a panorama of Rouen, with a
jumble of factory chimneys and church spires,
and rising above all the grand three-towered
cathedral.</p>

<p>Perhaps American children might like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
know what French trains are like; they are so
different from theirs in every way. To begin
with, there are first, second and third class cars,&mdash;carriages,
they are called,&mdash;and each carriage
is divided into compartments, each compartment
holding six persons in the first class,
three on each side, and eight persons in the
second, and in the third class, five on a side&mdash;ten
in all. There is a door and two small
windows in each end of a compartment.</p>

<p>The first and second classes have cushioned
seats, but there are only wooden benches in the
third. In many of the third class the divisions
between the compartments are not carried up
to the roof, and one can look over and see who
his neighbours may be. The people who
travel third class on French railways are a very
sociable lot, and every one soon gets to talking.
A French third class carriage under these conditions
is the liveliest place you were ever in,
especially when the train stops at a town on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
market-day and many people are about, as they
were on this occasion.</p>

<p>Well! Such a hubbub, and such a time as
they had getting all their various baskets and
belongings in with them.</p>

<p>The big ruddy-faced women pulled themselves
in with great difficulty, for these trains
are high from the ground and hard to get into,
especially when one has huge baskets on one's
arm, and innumerable boxes and bundles are
being pushed in after one by friends.</p>

<p>The men come with farming tools, bags of
potatoes, and their big <i>sabots</i>, all taking up a
lot of room.</p>

<p>One tall stout woman, with a basket in
either hand, got stuck in the doorway until
Uncle Daboll gave her a helping hand and her
friends pushed her from the outside. She
finally plumped down on a seat quite out of
breath, when from under the cover of one
basket two ducks' heads appeared with a loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"quack, quack, quack." "Ah, my beauties,
get back," and she tapped them playfully and
shut the lid down, but out popped their heads
again with another series of "quacks," just like
a double jack-in-the-box. How the children
laughed, and that made them all friends at
once.</p>

<p>Germaine offered to hold one of her baskets,
for there was not a bit of room in the
overhead racks, or anywhere else. When she
took it on her knee, she thought she saw a
gleam of bright eyes through the cracks, and
sure enough it was full of little white rabbits.
The old woman, seeing her interest, let her
stroke their sensitive little ears, while she told
how she had bought them at a <i>bon marché</i>, a
good bargain, and was taking them home to
her grandchild, just Germaine's age.</p>

<p>Next to her were two women who were
evidently carrying on some dispute that had
begun early in the day, and each was bent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
having the last word. So their talk went on,
an endless stream, while the fat woman sat
by and laughed at them both. Perhaps no
wonder one of them was cross. She looked
every little while at a big basket of eggs she
carried, some of which were broken, and with
small wonder, it would seem to inexperienced
eyes, for they were packed in the basket without
anything between them. When she found
one badly broken, she swallowed it, as much
as to say, "That is safe anyway," and then she
would talk faster than ever.</p>

<p>Uncle Daboll talked to the man next him
about market prices, and the cider crop, and
what a fine fruit year it was. One had only to
look out at the orchards they were passing to
see the truth of this, for the apple-trees were
so full of fruit that branches had to be propped
up with poles to keep them from breaking
down.</p>

<p>In the next compartment a party of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
were playing dominoes, one of the women who
was with them having spread out her apron
for a table.</p>

<p>Another party was evidently making up for
a meal they had lost, while doing business.
The mother took from a basket a part of a
big loaf, from which she cut slices and distributed
them, with a bit of cheese, to her party,
at the same time passing around a jug of cider.</p>

<p>There was an exciting time when one of the
chickens escaped from a market-basket and
had to be chased all over the carriage. Such
a clattering of tongues, flapping of wings, and
distressful clucks from the poor fowl, which
was at last caught just as she was about to fly
out of a window, were never heard before.</p>

<p>The chattering was increased by elaborate
good-byes, as one by one the passengers
dropped off at the small stations. No one
grumbled at having to help sort out the luggage
each time, but cheerfully and politely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
helped disentangle the belongings of the departing
ones, and carefully helped to lift the
baskets on to the platform, amid profuse
thanks, where more friends and relations met
them, and there was as much kissing on both
cheeks as if they had been on a long journey
instead of merely to market.</p>

<p>At one of the stops Germaine noticed a
woman, holding a horn and a small red flag,
standing by the sliding gates, where the road
crossed the railway. She had seen these
women before along the line, and her uncle
explained that the railway is fenced in on
either side by hedges or wire fencing, and
wherever a road or street crossed, there are
gates, which must be kept closed while trains
are passing. Not only must the gatekeeper,
who is generally a woman, have the gates tight
shut, but she must also stand beside them like
a soldier at his post, with her brass horn in
one hand and a red flag, rolled up, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
other, showing that she is prepared for any
emergency. If she were not there, the engineer
of the passing train would report it to
headquarters, and she would doubtless be dismissed.
The gatekeeper lives in a neat cottage
adjoining, and some minutes before each train
is due she takes the horn and flag from where
they hang on the wall, and is at her post.</p>

<p>At the station were M. and Madame Lafond
to welcome them home, and you can imagine
how everybody talked at once, and how much
there was to tell. The fête at Rouen was the
topic of conversation until its glories paled
before Petit Andelys' own special fête, which
was held some weeks after, and which our little
friends, with true French patriotism, thought
the finest in the world, not excepting the more
elaborate affair at Rouen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>THE MARKET AT GRAND ANDELYS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was always much noise and activity
in the farmyard of La Chaumière on Mondays,
for that was market-day at Grand Andelys,&mdash;<i>the</i>
important event in a country neighbourhood
in France.</p>

<p>For miles about, from the farms and small
villages, every one meets in the market-place
in the centre of the old town; not only to buy
and sell, but to talk and be sociable, to hear
news and tell it.</p>

<p>The French folk are very industrious, and
they do not take much time for idle gossip
unless there is some profit connected with it;
but on market-day they combine business with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pleasure, and make good bargains and hear all
the happenings of the countryside at the same
time.</p>

<p>"Come, Germaine," called out Marie, after
dinner on this particular Monday, "let us see
them put the little calves in the cart. Papa is
going to take four of them to market."</p>

<p>"I know it, but I felt so sorry I did not
want to see them go," said Germaine, for she
was very tender-hearted. Rather reluctantly
she followed Marie into the farmyard. Marie
was also very fond of the farm animals, but,
having been away at school, had naturally not
made such pets of them as had Germaine, who
petted everything, from the big plough-horses
to the tiny chickens just out of the shell.
They were to her like friends, and it was really
a grief to her when any of them were taken
away to the market. But she tried to conquer
the feeling, for it was part of her papa's business
to sell cattle in the market, and he did so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to provide for his two little daughters. All
French parents, of whatever position, will stint
and save in order to accumulate a "dot," as it
is called, for their children, and will make any
reasonable sacrifice to start them well in life.</p>

<p>The four little calves had been tied in the
cart with many bleatings, and much protesting
on the part of their mothers. "Papa is going
to take them to market, and mamma is to
drive you and me," said Marie.</p>

<p>Madame Lafond and the two girls climbed
into the cart hung high above its two great
wheels. All three sat together on the one seat,
which was quite wide. These country carts
are almost square and also rather pretty. They
are built of small panels of wood arranged in
more or less ornamental patterns, and are
usually painted in bright colours, and have,
also, a big hood which can be put up as a
protection from the rain.</p>

<p>The back of the cart was filled with baskets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of eggs, from a specially famous variety of
fowl, for which the farm was noted.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i099.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="crowds of people under umbrellas" />
<div class="caption">THE MARKET-SQUARE</div>
</div>

<p>The road to Les Andelys was crowded with
their neighbours and friends bound in the same
direction, and all in the same style of high
carts, drawn by a single horse.</p>

<p>They drove beside the river that flows
through the two villages, along which the
washerwomen gathered when they washed their
clothes. They knelt by a long plank and
gossiped as they beat out the dirt with a paddle,
rinsing the clothes afterward in the running
water of the stream itself.</p>

<p>At the town they drove into the courtyard
of the hotel of the "Bon Laboureur," where
there were dozens of country carts like their
own, from which the horses had already been
taken. They left the stableman to take charge
of theirs, and walked across to the market-square.</p>

<p>Booths, with awnings, held everything that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
could be imagined, from old cast-off pieces of
iron, locks, keys and the like, to the newest
kinds of clothing; for everything under the
sun is sold at these markets, and it is here
that the people do most of their shopping
rather than in the shops. Laces, crockery,
imitation jewelry and furniture, and most things
useful to man or beast are sold here.</p>

<p>Big umbrellas were stuck up for protection
against sun and rain. Some of them were of
brilliant colours, reds, blues, and greens, some
were faded to neutral tints by the weathers
of many market-days&mdash;looking like a field of
big mushrooms.</p>

<p>On one side of the square was the vegetable
and fruit market, where the women in their
neat cotton dresses and white caps sat under
their umbrellas, with heaped up baskets of
peas, beans, cauliflower, melons, and crisp green
stuff for salads around them. These vegetable
and fruit sellers are known as the "Merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the four seasons," because they sell, at
various times, the products of the four seasons
of the year.</p>

<p>Near by were the geese, ducks, and chickens
packed in big basket-crates, piled one on top of
the other, and all clucking and restless. Quantities
of little rabbits were also there, and when
a buyer wished to know if the rabbit were in
prime condition, he would lift it up by the
back of its neck just as one does a kitten, and
feel its backbone. One does not know
whether the poor rabbits like it or not, but
they look very frightened, and seem glad when
it is over.</p>

<p>Madame Lafond made her way toward
the egg-market, where the eggs are displayed
piled up in great baskets, stopping to speak
to a friend or an acquaintance by the way.
She was soon in her accustomed place, and
had opened up her eggs for her customers, for
eggs from La Chaumière never went begging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The two little children of the wagon-maker
joined Marie and Germaine, and the four
amused themselves looking at the booths, and
planning what they would buy if they had the
money, or amused themselves watching the
crowd that quite filled the big market-place.
"There are the English," some one said, and,
turning, Germaine saw her friend Mr. Carter,
and his wife, the Americans who were spending
the summer at the Belle Étoile, standing
at one of the booths, buying a <i>baton Normand</i>,
a rough stick of native wood, with a head of
plaited leather, and a leather loop to hold it
on the arm, for they are used by the peasants
in driving cattle, and they frequently want to
have their hands otherwise quite free. "This
will make me a good walking-stick," said Mr.
Carter, coming up to the little girls and shaking
hands with them. "This is your sister
back from school, eh? Well, when are you
two going to take that ride with me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been a promise of long standing that
when Marie was at home, they were to go
for a day's trip in Mr. Carter's big automobile.
"Well, I must fix on a day, and let M. Auguste
send word to your mamma so that you and
Marie can come to the Belle Étoile, and we
can start from there."</p>

<p>"Won't it be lovely?" said Marie; "we
shall feel as fine as M. Lecoq, the rich farmer
who comes to market in his great auto, wearing
his fur coat over his blouse, with his <i>sabots</i>
on just as if he was in the farm wagon, riding
behind his four white oxen."</p>

<p>All French working men wear the blouse.
It is almost like a uniform, and by the colour
of his blouse one can generally guess a man's
trade. Painters, masons, grocers, and bakers
wear the white blouse; mechanics and the
better class of farmers seem to prefer black,
and the ordinary peasants and labourers wear
blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The blouse is made like a big full shirt, and
reaches nearly to the knees. You will see
men well dressed in black broadcloth, white
shirts and neat ties, and over all the blouse.
It is really worn now to protect the clothes,
but is a survival of the olden times when all
trades wore a livery.</p>

<p>At the market at Grand Andelys one could
but notice the neatly dressed hair of the women
folk.</p>

<p>All Frenchwomen, of whatsoever class, always
dress their hair neatly and prettily: and
as the young girls seldom wear a hat or a
bonnet, it shows off to so much better advantage.
This is all very well in summer, but one
wonders that they do not take cold in winter.
The women wear felt slippers, and thrust their
feet into their <i>sabots</i>, when they go out, which
are not so clumsy as those of the men, dropping
them at the door when they come into
the house. You will always see several pairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of <i>sabots</i> around the entrance to the home of
a French working man.</p>

<p>The children by this time had got to where
the calves stood in their little fenced-in enclosure.
They were not put in the market by
the church with the big cattle, and Germaine
felt much happier when she heard that they
had been sold for farm purposes, and not for
veal to the big butcher in his long white apron,
who stood by, jingling his long knives that
hung at his side from a chain around his
waist.</p>

<p>As they were near the bakers', Marie suggested
they buy a <i>brioche</i>, and take it home
to eat with their chocolate. <i>Brioche</i> is a very
delicate bread made with eggs and milk, and
is esteemed as a great delicacy. The bakery
looked very tempting filled with bread of all
kinds and shapes,&mdash;sticks of bread a yard
long, loaves like a big ring with a hole in the
middle, big flat loaves which would nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cover a small table, twisted loaves and square
loaves.</p>

<p>When they had made their purchases and
rejoined their mother, they found her with
Madame Daboll, who told them that poor M.
Masson, the wealthy mill-owner, who had been
ill so long, was dead, and there was to be a
grand funeral at the church of St. Sauveur the
next day.</p>

<p>In France great respect is paid to the dead,
and funerals are conducted with as much pomp
as one's circumstances permit.</p>

<p>M. Masson was connected, in one way or
another, with nearly every one in the neighbourhood,
and the little church of St. Sauveur was
crowded with the friends and relatives all in
deep black, the men wearing a band of crape
on the arm. Over the church door was a sort
of black lambrequin with the letter M. embroidered
in silver. As the funeral passed
through the streets, the "<i>suisse</i>," the clergy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and the mourners, following the hearse on foot,
made an impressive and solemn sight. As the
cortège passed, all who met it bowed their
heads or removed their hats, as is the custom
all over Europe.</p>

<p>The only thing out of place seemed to be
the ugly wreaths made of black, white, and
purple beads, with which the hearse was
covered. To our taste they seem hideous,
but Germaine thought the white bead lilies
with black jet leaves very beautiful, for she was
used to seeing the graves in the small cemetery
covered with such tributes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>GERMAINE AND THE ARTIST</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> artists are fond of painting French
country life, and there is no part that they like
better than the picturesque old villages, farms,
and apple-orchards of Normandy, while perhaps
Les Andelys is one of their favourite
stopping-places.</p>

<p>Germaine had made many friends among
them, for they often came to draw or paint
the quaint jumble of old buildings at La
Chaumière.</p>

<p>Germaine and the English artist who was
staying at the Belle Étoile were great friends.
He was painting near the farm, and he often
dropped in to sit in their garden and drink a
glass of cider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>This warm bright morning Germaine could
see his white umbrella under the apple-trees,
whereupon she ran into the <i>laiterie</i> where her
mamma was putting away butter in stone jars
for winter use.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I see that Mr. Thomson is painting
again in the field. It is so hot. May I
not take him a glass of cider?"</p>

<p>"Yes, truly, my little one, but do not stay
too long, for I shall need you later to help
me." Madame Lafond knew that when her
little daughter was watching the painting of a
picture, she would forget all about how time
flies.</p>

<p>Germaine went into the dark cellar where
the large casks of cider were kept cool, and
drawing off a jug full, took a glass, and holding
an umbrella over her, carefully carried it down
the hillside to Mr. Thomson, who was lying
full length on the grass, smoking vigorously
and scowling at his picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Germaine," he called out, when he
caught sight of her, "you are a jewel, a good
little girl to bring me a cold drink. It was
just what I wanted, and I was too lazy to walk
up to the farm and ask for it. I am stuck and
can't do a bit of work. I don't believe this
picture is good for anything, after all."</p>

<p>Germaine could not believe this, for had she
not heard Mr. Carter tell of pictures that Mr.
Thomson had sold for so many thousands of
francs that it took away her breath. Besides,
did it not look just like her papa's wheat-field,
with a bit of the river showing between the
trees?</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I think it is a most
beautiful picture," she said as she looked at it
admiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh! if all the folk who buy pictures had
your good taste, Germaine, how lucky we artist
chaps would be," he said, draining the cider
jug. "I feel much refreshed and must get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
work again, for the light is changing fast. Sit
there in the shade, child, and tell me what you
are going to do at the fête of St. Sauveur
next week."</p>

<p>There was nothing Germaine liked better
than to watch the picture grow under the
quickly moving brushes; and Mr. Thomson
talked to her so pleasantly in his queer French
that it amused her. Germaine never smiled,
even when he made mistakes in grammar that
a French child of eight would not have made.</p>

<p>The French are a proverbially polite people,
and at no time is their politeness so apparent
as when a foreigner is speaking their language.
They never laugh nor take the slightest notice
of the worst blunders, but with the greatest
pains try to understand them, and even
go out of their way to set them right.</p>

<p>But to-day it was not the fête that Germaine
wanted to talk about. "Tell me more about
Paris," she said, shyly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Germaine, you are just like all the
world&mdash;wild about Paris," laughed Mr.
Thomson. He lived in Paris during the
winter, and his big studio looked out on the
fine old gardens of the Luxembourg, and from
the windows could be seen the gilded dome of
the Hôtel des Invalides, under which is the
tomb of the great Napoleon.</p>

<p>It was the dream of Germaine's life to see
this wonderful city of Paris that she had heard
so much about. So she listened eagerly when
Mr. Thomson told her of the broad boulevards
shaded by chestnut-trees, with fine shops
on either side, and the great avenue of the
Champs Élysées, at the end of which stands
the Arch of Triumph, erected by Napoleon in
memory of his victories.</p>

<p>Along this avenue passes the gay world of
Paris in carriages, automobiles, and on foot,
bound for the Bois de Boulogne. A part of
this great park is set aside for the special use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of the children. No noisy automobile is
allowed in this special enclosure, and carriages
can only drive at a moderate pace. Here the
Parisian mothers bring their children for a
good time. They can romp over the grass
and play among the pretty flower-beds; have
games of tennis, croquet, or battledore and
shuttlecock (which is a favourite game with
them), while their older relatives sit around on
little camp-stools, which every one carries with
them to the parks, and talk or do fancy work.</p>

<p>There are ornamental refreshment houses
where cakes and milk and sweet drinks can be
had: thus it is a veritable children's paradise!</p>

<p>"But there is even more fun to be had in
the gardens of the Tuileries; <i>there</i> is where
I would like to take you, Germaine," said
Mr. Thomson.</p>

<p>"There among bright flower-beds and
shady alleys the little children play games
around the feet of the marble statues; roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
their hoops; run after their toy balloons; and
trundle their dolls about, or sail toy boats with
red, blue, or white sails, on the little pond,
while their <i>bonnes</i>, or nurses we would call
them, in their long cloaks and big caps with
streamers of bright ribbons, sit gossiping on
the benches.</p>

<p>"We would walk along until we found
Guignol, which English and American girls and
boys call 'Punch and Judy;' but they would
enjoy it just as much as do the French children,
for even though Mr. Punch and Mrs.
Judy speak French, the show is just the same.</p>

<p>"And then we would go on a little farther
and join the crowd standing around a man
with birds flying all about him. He is the
'bird charmer,' who seems to draw the birds
to him by some magic. He whistles, and they
perch on his head, shoulders, and hands, eat
out of his mouth, and perform tricks on the
stick he holds in his hand. This greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
amuses the children, and they are always ready
to give the man a few sous, so it is a profit to
him as well as an amusement."</p>

<p>Then there is the great Cathedral of Notre
Dame, which is probably the best known
church in all the world. It stands on the
river bank, for Paris is built on either side of
that same Seine that Germaine sees through
the trees in the distance as she sits under the
apple-trees on her father's farm.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomson tells her also of the new
Palace of Art, where, among many thousands
of others, he hopes to exhibit this picture he
is now painting; and of the beautiful Alexander
III. bridge near it, with its lofty white
columns crowned by the great golden-winged
horses, named after a Czar of Russia, for the
French and Russian people are very friendly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! Paris is a great city," Mr.
Thomson would always say when he had
finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa said when I was older perhaps he
would take Marie and me there," said Germaine.
"But now I must go," she added,
jumping up; "mamma will be waiting for me
to help her with the chickens," and saying
good-bye to her friend, Germaine ran toward
the farmyard gate.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>THE FÊTE OF ST. SAUVEUR</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">St. Sauveur</span> is the patron saint of Petit
Andelys, and its little church is the church of
St. Sauveur.</p>

<p>Each year Petit Andelys, as do most of the
towns of France, celebrates the fête-day of its
patron, and does it so well that the lustre of
the fête has spread far and wide, bringing
many visitors, which pleases the good folk of
the little town, for they are proud of it and
everything connected therewith.</p>

<p>The fête-day of St. Sauveur has no connection
whatever with Petit Andelys' big twin
town of Grand Andelys, which has its own
fête, but nothing like so grand. There is some
little jealousy between the two Andelys. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
size and importance of Grand Andelys throws
the other quite in the shade, but Petit Andelys
has the river, and the people of Grand Andelys
have to walk a dusty mile before they reach it,
and that is one reason that visitors like the
Belle Étoile.</p>

<p>So Petit Andelys arranges its own fête. The
mayor and its leading citizens organize committees,
and great preparations go on for weeks
beforehand.</p>

<p>One day the children running out of school
at the noon hour saw, in the square in front
of the church, many wagons with poles, and
flapping canvas strewn about. These were the
booths for the fair, which were being put up.</p>

<p>The great attraction of every fête is its fair,
and these <i>foires</i>, as the French also call them,
move about the country from town to town in
wagons like an old-fashioned circus, planning
to reach an important town for some special
occasion&mdash;such as its fête-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The participants in these fairs live in their
lumbering wagons very much as do gipsies,
selling all sorts of knickknacks, and performing
little plays, or feats of agility or strength.</p>

<p>In a few days the little town was dressed
out with flags and wreaths, gay streamers and
paper lanterns.</p>

<p>Marie and Germaine, who were staying at
their Uncle Daboll's for the fête, were awakened
at five o'clock on the opening day by a succession
of terrific noises, which were set forth on the
official programme as a "Salvo of Artillery."</p>

<p>They were soon dressed and out, but even
at that early hour the whole town was astir.
Later on the booths in the square opened up
for business.</p>

<p>There was a merry-go-round, "flying horses"
the children call them, with big pink pigs to
ride on, and swings in the shape of boats, and
a marvellous "wheel of fortune" for those
who wanted to try their luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Germaine never tired of admiring what
seemed to her the most beautiful things set out
for sale.</p>

<p>Jean's great ambition was to hit some of the
pipes in the shooting-gallery, and win a wonderful
knife that contained everything from
a corkscrew to a file.</p>

<p>The real gaiety, however, only began in the
evening, when a torchlight procession marched
up and down the main streets.</p>

<p>First came the "Salvo of Artillery" again,
which, after all, was a very simple affair. A
cartridge was placed on a paving-stone and
struck with a big hammer. It made a tremendous
noise, however, and everybody
jumped, and Germaine put her fingers in her
ears when she saw the hammer coming down.</p>

<p>Behind came men and boys carrying lighted
paper lanterns, and then the band of the <i>pompiers</i>
(the village fire department), and then
more people, while all along the route was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
burned red and green fire. Lanterns and
fairy lamps in front of the houses and around
the square were lighted, and the band played
on a platform near the booths for the young
people to dance.</p>

<p>Jean rode on one of the pink pigs on the
merry-go-round, but Marie and Germaine
preferred the chairs shaped like swans, for
they were afraid of slipping off the round
pigs. The only trouble was that the man
who had charge of these wonderful beasts cut
the rides rather short.</p>

<p>Uncle Daboll and M. Lafond broke several
of the pipes in the shooting-gallery, and Germaine's
papa even hit one of the funny paper
ducks that kept bobbing up, and got a walking-stick
for his pains, but no one succeeded
in hitting the white ball that swung at the end
of a string.</p>

<p>Germaine's mamma bought her a little toy
<i>laiterie</i>, which looked just like the one at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
farm. There was a little cow on one side,
and in the other the milk-pans and churn&mdash;all
true to life.</p>

<p>Perhaps the booth which had the most custom
was the one with the gingerbread, which
is a very popular variety of cake throughout
France. Our little friends were soon there
buying quite a menagerie of animals made of
gingerbread. Jean chose a horse, Marie an
elephant, and Germaine a cat, which, strange
to say, was as big as Marie's elephant.</p>

<p>Then they all crowded into the little theatre;
the funniest one you ever saw. The
stage was made up out of a wagon, and the
audience sat under an awning in front. There
was no scenery, but a piece of cloth with a
queer-looking picture painted on it, and the
actors never changed their costumes once, but
every one laughed and enjoyed it as much
as if it had been the big theatre in Grand
Andelys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>It was late when everybody got home, that
is, it was ten o'clock, which is a very late hour
for a French village, where every one is usually
sound asleep by half-past eight or nine. The
fête was to last a week, and every day had
something new to offer.</p>

<p>The next day Jean announced, "There is a
circus down on the quay," as he burst into the
kitchen where the family were gathered for
breakfast. "The baker's boy told me he
could see them from the bakery. They came
late last night, and are waiting to get permission
from the mayor to put up their tents in
the town."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's go and see them at once!" said
Marie and Germaine in the same breath. Jean
quickly disposed of his breakfast by taking a
slice of bread and eating it as he went.</p>

<p>The quay presented a lively appearance indeed.
There were nearly a dozen gaudily
painted wagons, while near by were tethered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the horses. The women were preparing the
morning meal outside the wagons, which served
for houses, while the men fed the horses or
fished in the river, and the children played
about, or followed the visitors with outstretched
hands asking for pennies.</p>

<p>"I should like to give them something,"
said Marie, "but you know they are not
allowed to beg while they are in the village,
and we should not encourage them to break
the law. I will go back, though, and ask
aunty to give me some cakes for them," and
the kind-hearted girl ran back to Madame
Daboll's.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jean was wondering what was
inside the wagons with CIRQUE painted in
big black letters on their sides. Near a bright
yellow van were tethered two goats which were
carried for their milk. Goat's milk is much
used in France among the poorer classes, especially
in the southern part of the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the white goat's milk cheeses are rather good,
when one gets used to the peculiar flavour.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="Circus in the woods" />
<div class="caption">THE CIRCUS</div>
</div>

<p>Germaine was getting acquainted with a lot
of dark-skinned little children, who looked
chubby and well taken care of in their neat
cotton dresses.</p>

<p>Their mother was a gipsy-like woman who
had fancy baskets for sale, and she told Germaine
she had nine children, which set
Germaine to wondering how they all stowed
themselves away in the one wagon. It was a
big one, to be sure, divided into two rooms,
and wonderfully compact, and as they sat and
eat out-of-doors on the ground or the steps
of their wagons, they could easily get on
without tables and chairs.</p>

<p>Here Marie came running up with her
cakes, which she divided among the little ones
who gathered about her.</p>

<p>By this time they had got the desired permission
to open up the circus on the square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and that afternoon our three little friends had
the pleasure of seeing the horse that could
find a hidden handkerchief, the performing
dogs, and all the other wonders of the
show.</p>

<p>The grand events of the fête were saved up
for the last day. There were to be the sports
in the afternoon, and a grand illumination and
display of fireworks in the evening. The
sports, in which the young boys were to take
part, were held in the square. Jean was to
participate in one of these, and was one of
the first to be at the roped-in enclosure in
the middle of which stood two high poles.
Between these poles were hung a dozen or
more tin buckets all filled with water, except
the middle one. In this was a new five-franc
piece. To each bucket was attached a string,
and when a boy was blindfolded, and an enormous
grotesque mask put over his head, it
was a somewhat difficult task to walk up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to pull the string of the bucket which held the
five-franc piece. Should he pull any of the
others, down would tumble a pail full of water
all over him, amid the laughter and jeers of
the bystanders. Jean had talked for weeks
beforehand how he would spend the five francs
if he were fortunate enough to win it. He
had in imagination bought most of the things
in M. Carré's shop. Five francs, which is
equal to one American dollar, was a big sum
to a little French boy such as Jean.</p>

<p>"I do hope you will get it, Jean!" whispered
Germaine; "remember to try and walk
straight." Jean was so excited as he groped
his way along he could not have told whether
he was going backwards or forwards. "Oh,
he will get it! Keep where you are! You're
in the right place!" shouted Jean's friends, as
they watched his hand touch the strings with
indecision. Little Germaine held her breath.
"Oh, he has done it!" she cried, jumping up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and down and clapping her hands. "Marie,
he has it!" as the bag with the five franc
piece tumbled on top of his head.</p>

<p>Jean was the hero of the hour among the
children, and some of his prize was soon spent
at one of the booths on <i>sucre du pomme</i>, which
was distributed lavishly among his admiring
friends. <i>Sucre du pomme</i>, by the by, is a very
nice candy made in sticks of various sizes from
sugar and the drippings of the cider apples.
Each stick is carefully wrapped in a pretty
paper, and tied together, in bundles of six or a
dozen, with bright ribbons.</p>

<p>Jean's father and M. Lafond took part in
the men's sports on the river-front, but neither
had Jean's luck. One feat was quite difficult.
It was something like what children elsewhere
know as "climbing the greasy pole," but in
this case it was a bar that extended over the
river, in which at regular intervals were placed,
hanging downward, wooden pegs. These pegs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
were well greased, and one had to swing himself
by his hands from one of these pegs to
another in order to reach the extreme end
of the bar, where was fastened a small bag
of money. Well, you may imagine this was
not easy to do, and generally about the third
or fourth peg the participant would drop into
the water with a splash, and be picked up by
a waiting boat, to the intense amusement of
the lookers-on, who thronged the banks of the
river. After many trials, one venturesome
fellow grabbed the bag just before he slipped
off, taking it with him, however, into the water.</p>

<p>After this came the diving matches and the
swimming contests, and then everybody got
ready for the evening's grand wind-up. In the
Belle Étoile all was bustle and confusion;
the maids were flying about, for there were
many visitors who had come in for the usual
<i>apéritif</i>. The café was full, the gardens were
filled up with extra tables, and M. Auguste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was quite distracted in his endeavours to be
polite and attentive to every one, besides stopping
to take a glass with his friends, as was his
custom. He had barely a moment to pat
Germaine on the cheek, and to hear the story
of Jean's success.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter, with the help of the young lady
artists, was hanging lanterns in the front windows,
and getting ready a big lot of Roman
candles as the contribution of the visitors of
the Belle Étoile to the evening's gaieties, while
Mimi, the white cat, sat in the doorway regarding
things with her usual lofty air of superiority.</p>

<p>As it grew dark, our two parties found themselves
once more on the quay, amid a great
throng of tourists, country folk, visitors in
automobiles and farm carts, on bicycles, and
in lumbering buses from out-of-the-way
villages.</p>

<p>The prosaic little neighbourhood was changed
for the night into a gorgeous panorama of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and colour. The river banks burned with red,
green, and white Bengal fires. Queer boats
rigged with golden lamps, and sails of coloured
lanterns, floated down the stream, and into the
sky burst showers of gold and silver stars.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i135.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="large house on a hill" />
<div class="caption">CHÂTEAU GAILLARD</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly there was heard a great boom, and
from the top of Château Gaillard rose a red
cloud of fire, and the old walls and turrets
stood out red against the dark blue sky, a
beacon for miles of country roundabout. It
was a mimic reproduction of the destruction of
the grand old castle many hundreds of years
ago.</p>

<p>Germaine caught Marie's hand, it seemed so
real. It seemed as if her cherished playground
were crumbling away, and that never again
could she picture the great king and his knights
riding out of its massive gateway to do battle
against its foes.</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>Messieurs</i> and <i>Mesdames</i>, is it not a
wonderful sight; a grand occasion for our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
city?" The voice brought Germaine back to
earth again. It was the indefatigable little <i>sous-Commissaire</i>,
the one policeman of the village,
speaking to them. The little man had come
unwearied and triumphant through the excitements
of the great day. Ah! it was he who
had managed it all so successfully! It was he
who had kept order among the vast throng.
No other <i>sous-Commissaire</i> in all France could
have done better, and the little man swelled
with pride.</p>

<p>The light had faded off the château; the
last rocket had been fired; the band of the
<i>pompiers</i> played the "Marseillaise,"&mdash;the national
air,&mdash;and the great event of the year for
Petit Andelys was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>AN AUTOMOBILE JOURNEY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> one morning three of the happiest
children in France were stowed away in the
back of Mr. Carter's big automobile. They
were still more delighted when Pierre, Mr.
Carter's fine, black French poodle, jumped up
on the seat beside him, looking very jaunty
with his fore-locks tied up with a blue ribbon,
and as complacent as if he was driving the auto
himself.</p>

<p>"I thought we would go by way of La
Roche-Guyon to Mantes and have lunch there,
and then come back by way of Vernon; that
ought to show you children a bit of the
country," said Mr. Carter.</p>

<p>The children were ready for anything, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
off they went at a pace that nearly took away
their breath.</p>

<p>They were soon flying through rolling farmlands,
where the various crops were planted in
such regular fields that they looked like a great
patchwork quilt, with squares of green, yellow,
and brown spread out for miles. There were
no divisions by fences or hedges, except sometimes
at each corner of a farm a small white
stone marked the boundary. Suddenly, they
slowed down.</p>

<p>"Here is something which always stops me,"
said Mr. Carter. "It is like running into a
big spider's web."</p>

<p>A woman coming up the road was driving
eight or nine cows, each attached to a long
rope, which she held in her hand. It seemed
like a maze to an outsider, but she drew in
first one rope, and then twisted another,
and pulled back another, until she finally
got her charges to one side of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The cows are taken out to pasture, where
there are no regular fields where they may run
loose. So they must be guarded in this manner,
and when they have eaten one spot up clean,
they are taken on to another.</p>

<p>Farther up the road two children were
watching some goats on the side of the road,
but in this case each goat's rope was tied to an
iron stake which was driven in the ground, so
the children could amuse themselves until it
was time to move the animals on to a fresh
bit of pasturage.</p>

<p>"Your horses wear gay clothes," said Mr.
Carter, as they passed a great lumbering wagon,
swung between two big wheels, drawn tandem-wise,&mdash;that
is, one horse in front of the other,&mdash;by
five heavy-limbed Norman horses.</p>

<p>Around their big clumsy wooden collars,
which are usually painted in bright colours,
was draped a dark blue sheepskin blanket.
On their heads bobbed big tassels of blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and red, or blue, red, and yellow, which so
dangled in their eyes that one wonders how
they could see at all.</p>

<p>The leader was more finely dressed than the
others. His neck-blanket had long stole-like
ends, that hung almost to the ground, and an
extra high collar with more tassels. All this
may not be comfortable for the horses, but
they looked so very picturesque, one hopes
that they did not mind it.</p>

<p>The automobile now whizzed by a team of
slow-moving cream-coloured oxen,&mdash;beautiful
beasts with yokes twisted around their horns
instead of around their necks. They never
so much as lifted their sleepy eyes to look at
our party.</p>

<p>"This is another frequent obstacle in the
way of the automobilist," said Mr. Carter, as
they came in sight of a flock of sheep with
their shepherd, which completely blocked up
the road. "But I do not object to stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
in this case, for it is worth one's while to watch
the sheep-dogs do their work."</p>

<p>The children stood up in the auto and
watched the amusing performance with much
interest, and Pierre barked his appreciation.
The dogs knew perfectly well which side of
the road must be left open for the automobile,
and they began to drive the sheep toward the
other side, pushing them and barking at
them; the slow ones they would catch by the
wool, give them a little shake, as much as to
say "you had better move quickly," and then
pull them out of the way, looking back every
few minutes to see how near to them was the
automobile.</p>

<p>"They act with as much judgment as
human beings," said Mr. Carter, as he carefully
steered through the flock. The shepherd,
who had let the dogs do the work, was
a fine-looking fellow, in a long grayish white
cloak, striped with colour, which made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
look like a shepherd of Bible times. In the
field near by stood his house, a kind of big
box on wheels, just large enough for him and
his dogs to sleep in, which he could move
about where he liked.</p>

<p>They were now running down a long, steep
hill into La Roche-Guyon.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Germaine, "there are chimneys
and stovepipes coming up out of the
ground; is it not funny?"</p>

<p>"Those are the cave-dwellings," explained
Mr. Carter. "These people have cut their
houses in the side of the cliff; you can see the
openings to them, often in tiers one above
the other, and those chimneys you see come
from the houses. There are many such dwellings
all over the country, especially along
the other great river of France, the Loire."</p>

<p>"Are people living in them?" asked Jean,
"and how can they see in them? Are they
not dark and gloomy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, as you can see, there is always a
door and often one or two windows. The
poorer people do sometimes live in them,
though not so much as they used to many
years ago when the French peasant was much
worse off than he is now. The working people
are now building and owning their own
little homes, and these caves are being used
more for storehouses and, in the grape districts,
for cellars in which to store the wine-crop."</p>

<p>"I should not like to live in the ground
like that," declared Jean.</p>

<p>They only stopped long enough in the
town to look at the big château, which to-day
belongs to the noble French family in whose
possession it has been for hundreds of years.
This splendid building was very odd, for the
back had been built into the high chalk-cliff
which towers above it.</p>

<p>"I can see the towers of a big church in
the distance," said Germaine, presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the church of Mantes, and we
shall soon be in the town," replied Mr. Carter.
"It is said that this church was built by
William the Conqueror to replace one that
was destroyed while he was besieging the town,
and it was at this same siege that he was mortally
wounded."</p>

<p>After lunch and a walk around the town,
they started for home over a fine broad road
shaded with trees.</p>

<p>"This is a 'National Road,'" said Jean.
"Papa told me about these great highways
laid out all over France by the great Napoleon,
so that soldiers could be moved easily from
one part of the country to another."</p>

<p>"Oh, look! What is that big gray thing
in the sky just above that clump of trees? It
looks like a fish," suddenly cried Marie, as
they were passing a small village lying just off
the highroad.</p>

<p>"Why, bless me if it is not an air-ship!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
ejaculated Mr. Carter. "I remember now
that the big sugar manufacturer lives near here,
who is so much interested in flying-machines,
and every now and again he sends one up to
find out how his experiments are getting on.
Well, children, that is a sight for you that I did
not anticipate. Who knows, however, but
what you will live yet to see a flying-machine
express going between Rouen and Paris, stopping
at Les Andelys to take up passengers."</p>

<p>This was sufficient to give the party something
to talk about until they reached Vernon,
where they stopped at a pretty riverside café
to have a <i>sirop de groseille</i>, and, as Mr. Carter
jokingly said, to rest the horses.</p>

<p>It was still early when they again came in
sight of Château Gaillard, and so ended a blissful
day for our young people, who had something
to talk about for many a long winter
evening.</p>
